                I am a commercial and instrument rated pilot. I have just around 300 hours of flight time
                and have a large passion for the aviation industry as a whole. I earned a 
                <span className="text-orange-500"> Bachelor's Degree in Aviation</span> from San Jose State University.

                <br />
                <br />

                I have flown all up and down the west coast of the US and loved the experience and amazing views
                I had along the way.

                Though I have moved my focus to various areas of technology and programming, I still love aviation
                and hope to continue to exercise this passion in my spare time as a hobbyist as well as through
                open source projects.
