            <p className="info-about">I am currently finishing up my B.S in Aviation (Professional Flight) at SJSU.
                While my focus is on flight and becoming a pilot, the coursework for my degree was very diverse.
                My education ranged from business and statistics to flying and aerodynamics.</p>
            <p className="info-about">I am an instrument rated pilot with just over 250 flight hours.
                I am pursuing my commercial license and will be finished with that soon.</p>
            <p className="info-about">I have recently decided to make the transition into professional programming
                so flying has take the spot of a hobby for the time being. I am very excited to find interesting, new
                ways to combine my two passions for programming and aviation.</p>
